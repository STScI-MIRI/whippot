    "This notebook provides a general user interface for doing TA in some some target, and then placing some other target on the reference position of some other aperture. The user provides the RA and Dec coordinates for the target acquisition (ACQ) star and science (SCI) star, and a telescope roll angle. These tools will then compute a) the \"Special Requirment Offset\" X and Y values needed to place the SCI star at the reference position, and b) the final coordinates of the SCI and ACQ stars. Coordinates are given in IDL (https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-observatory-hardware/jwst-target-observability-and-observatory-coordinate-system/jwst-instrument-ideal-coordinate-systems#gsc.tab=0).\n",
    "\n",
    "The user can also provide a list of extra targets in the field in the format specified below, and their IDL coordinates will also be computed. As such, this notebook is useful not just for planning target acquisition, but also for predicting to high precision the final positions of astronomical bodies in the field of view.\n",

    "- With installing the module:\n",
    "  1. Navigate in a terminal to the directory where you have downloaded the module. This should contain the `setup.py` file.\n",
    "  2. Activate your desired python environment.\n",
    "  3. Run `pip install .`\n",
    "  4. Copy this notebook to your working directory, and run your jupyter kernel in the appropriate environment.\n",
    "- Without installing the module:\n",
    "  1. Copy this notebook and `whippot_tools.py` to your working directory.\n",
    "  2. In the cell below, change `from whippot import whippot_tools` to `import whippot_tools`\n",
    "  3. Open the notebook as you normally would. The following python modules must be installed in the working enviroment:\n",
    "     -  `ipywidgets`\n",
    "     - `numpy`\n",
    "     - `matplotlib`\n",

    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the cell below, which will generate an interactive widget in the output space.\n",
    "2. Select your instrument and science aperture from the drop-down menus.\n",
    "   - An \"aperture\" is a region of the telescope that can be used for pointing. This terminology is adapted from the Science Instrument Aperture File (SIAF)\n",
    "     - This technical report is a useful, if incomplete, reference: https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/jwst/documentation/technical-documents/_documents/JWST-STScI-007030.pdf\n",
    "   - The science aperture names can be a bit opaque, but you should be able to guess which one corresponds to your observation.\n",
    "   - If you have access to data that uses the subarray of interest, you can check the header for the \"APERNAME\" there and match it.\n",
    "   - ¡¡Warning!! There are *many* choices for apertures and their names can be opaque. If in doubt, speak with someone familiar with your instrument and the SIAF.\n",
    "4. Enter the RA and Dec coordinates of your acquisition and science targets.\n",
    "   - the frame must be 'ICRS'\n",
    "   - the units must be in decimal degrees\n",
    "5. Enter the PA angle of the V3 axis of the telescope at the instrument reference point.\n",
    "   - In APT, this corresponds to the \"Specify PA range using V3PA\" option under Special Requirements.\n",
    "   - This angle is given in data headers as \"ROLL_REF\"\n",
    "6. If you wish to know the positions of other stars in the field of view, you can enter them in the \"Other stars\" box\n",
    "   - The format is `label: (ra, dec)` where `ra` and `dec` are given in decimal degrees\n",
    "   - There is currently no error checking for formatting; you will just make it crash/get a wrong answer\n",
    "   - For multi-line entries, you may need to type them elsewhere and they copy-paste the list into the box\n",
    "7. Press \"Compute offset\" to get the offsets to enter into APT (you may need to press it twice).\n",
    "   - You will also get the positions in IDL coordinates of all the stars before and after the slew.\n",
    "   - For same-target TA, a hack is to enter the same position for the ACQ and SCI target. In the examples below that use an initialization dictionary, omitting `acq_ra` and `acq_dec` fields will cause this to be done automatically.\n"
